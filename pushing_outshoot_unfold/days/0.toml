You hear the staticky sound of the school speakers turning on.
# pause()

Everyone sitting on the edge of their seat, waiting... 
# green()
anticipating....
# normal()
# pause()

You hear the principal say:

# italic()
		'Due to the current conditions,
		we will unfortunately be 
		resuming classes remotely.'
# normal()
# pause()

These were the words said on March 13th of 2020, school year of 2020-2021.
Times of foreshadowing twirl in your mind right then and there.
# pause()
One by one,[green()] classmates had stopped showing up to school, 
any physical contact had been forbidden,
and there was the intense sanitization of desks, tables, and chairs.
[normal()]
# pause()
You start to tune out the sound of the announcements, you feel like the world is stopping right in its tracks.
# green()
You realize that any school activities would be canceled.
# normal()
All sports, games, clubs, and field trips.
# pause()
# green()
Learning from home? You had found that pretty exciting and assured yourself that this wouldnâ€™t last very long.
