It’s the last day of school! Today you’re supposed to go drop off your textbooks at your middle school. Your middle school is doing a last meeting activity with your teachers. You teachers are at different stations and they wave to you as you drive around to each station. 

One of your teachers hands you a note, while another gives you your yearbook. As you wave goodbye to your 8th grade teachers, you feel a bit sad. This wasn’t really the way you wanted this year to end, but this is what is needed to keep everyone safe. 

You start to flip through your yearbook in the car. First you look through the table to contents. It must be upsetting for the fifth graders to end their year this way too, you think to yourself. You can relate to them. Your mind focuses back onto your yearbook.

Where do you look first: 8th grade class pictures, spirit week, 8th grade baby pictures.

8th grade class pictures: you scan through the faces of your classmates and friends. It hits you that you haven’t seen each other in person in a long time. You really miss talking to your friends and hanging out with them.

School Sports: When you were still in school, you were part of the soccer team. It was really fun going to the soccer games and practicing with your teammates. You hope that you’ll be able to meet up with your classmates soon after Covid-19 restrictions lighten up.

8th grade baby pictures: You spot your baby pictures, and you burst out laughing. Your dad had selected your baby pictures for you. You didn’t even remember submitting it. In the pictures, you are sitting on the ground next to some foam building blocks. One of your hands holding a t.v remote in your mouth, and the other hand holding a foam building block next to your ear.

Because you didn’t get to celebrate the end of 8th grade with your friends, your parents decided to throw you a graduation party, to give some light to the end of this year.
