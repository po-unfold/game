Instead of being stuck in your house all day doing homework, you occasionally go outside to your backyard for some fresh air. 

After finishing your homework, you decide to [green()]spend time with your little sister. 
# normal()
# pause()

Playing with little sister:
# pause()
# day7a()
# pause()

# green()
This was really fun for you. You realize that you should play more with your sister. 

This has made you really happy. You found a way to cope with the stress you’ve had with school.
