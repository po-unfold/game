This wasn’t really the way you wanted this year to end, but this is what is needed to keep everyone safe. 
# pause()
You start to flip through your yearbook in the car. First you look through the table to contents. 
# normal()
It must be upsetting for the fifth graders to end their year this way too, you think to yourself. You can relate to them. Your mind focuses back onto your yearbook.

Because you didn’t get to celebrate the end of 8th grade with your friends, your parents decided to throw you a graduation party, to give some light to the end of this year.
