Today is the [green()]first day of your freshman year[normal()]!

Classes aren’t that different from middle school, but you are [green()]worried about the homework workload[normal()]. No zoom problems.
# pause()

You look at all the profiles on the zoom meeting. You remember that there are people from 4 schools mixed together. You don’t see many familiar faces. 
# pause()

# green()
You remember how awkward zoom meetings are. Especially going into breakout rooms. Most people had their cameras off, and a lot of people didn’t talk at all. 
# normal()

Some [green()]classes[normal()] were [green()]kind of confusing[normal()] too. You had to get used to the [green()]strange class schedules[normal()]. You couldn’t believe that you had 20 minutes of passing time between classes.
# pause()

To take a break from school, you decide to go through a This or That book.
