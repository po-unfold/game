Today is the 4th of July. 
# normal()
Usually, your parents would invite over family for a BBQ party. 
# green()
You notice that your parents were also sad about not being able to see family too. Most people canceled doing fireworks this year, too. 

Thinking about this makes you pretty sad, and you spend most of the day being gloomy. 
# pause()

That evening, your parents tell you that they planned some fun activities for you and your sister to do this July 4th. 
# green()
You and your parents are going to try to bake something for after dinner dessert. Happy that you wouldnâ€™t spend your 4th of July gloomily, you instantly agree.
