Today is the 4th of July. Usually, your parents would invite over family for a BBQ party. You notice that your parents were also sad about not being able to see family too. You would also look forward to watching fireworks with your friends, but most people canceled doing fireworks this year. Thinking about this makes you pretty sad, and you spend most of the day being gloomy. 

That evening, your parents tell you that they (or your sister) planned some fun activities to do this July 4th. They said that they would try something new today. You and your parents would try to bake something for after dinner dessert. Happy that you wouldnâ€™t spend your 4th of July gloomily, you instantly agree. 

Two things stand out to you the most in the baking cookbook that your mom has: Cupcakes or Strawberry Shortcake.

Cupcakes: You and your parents decide to make red velvet cupcakes with blue frosting to match the 4th of July theme. You decide to work on your frosting piping skills next time you make cupcakes. Nevertheless, everything turned out great. 
Strawberry Shortcake: After struggling to cut the strawberries into even slices, you whip up the frosting. Then you layer each ingredient. First the cake, then whipped cream, then strawberries, then cake, then whipped cream, and finally, strawberries on top in a cool design.

It was fun for you to do this family activity, since sometimes you feel bored and isolated while in quarantine.
