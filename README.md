# Pushing Outshoot Unfold

This is the source code for a game about a teen getting through Covid-19.

It is a text based game, but we can add awesome ASCII graphics:
```
          (this is an owl)
         /
  , _ , /
 ( o o )
/'` ' `'\
|'''''''|
|\\'''//|
   """
```

If you edit anything, just add comments explaining it! But anything is fine to add.

The app is auto-built on the cloud on GitHub. The releases can be found [here](https://github.com/po-unfold/game/releases).

The main code is in the `pushing_outshoot_unfold/` folder.

The `sailboat.toml` file is the configuration for all of the project, so that [`sailboat`](https://github.com/cole-wilson/sailboat) can build it.
